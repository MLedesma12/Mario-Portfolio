      I'm looking to be great at web design, and that's why I'm here. Life has
      come full circle and allowed me to dive into what I originally wanted to
      do after high school.

      <h3>High School</h3>
      <p style="font-size: large">
        I took a web design course in my senior year of high school. This was in
        the fall of 2005 which also happened to be the peak of MySpace
        popularity. I had such a fun time in that class. What made it more fun
        for me was that my cousin also took that same class during his junior
        year and we sat next to each other every day. He's far more tech-savvy
        than I, so it helped in the long run.
